*The Sorcerer's Apprentice* is a fun fantasy movie released in 2010. It's about a young man named Dave who becomes an apprentice to a powerful sorcerer, Balthazar. Together, they battle an evil sorceress named Morgana and try to stop her from taking over the world.

## Main Characters:
- **Balthazar Blake**: A wise sorcerer who trains Dave to use magic.
- **Dave Stutler**: A regular guy who discovers he has magic powers and becomes Balthazar’s apprentice.
- **Morgana le Fay**: The evil sorceress who wants to use magic to destroy the world.

## Why I love it:
I love this movie because it mixes magic and adventure in a cool way. The special effects are awesome, especially the part where Balthazar uses magic to control a bunch of brooms. It’s also fun to watch how Dave learns about magic and grows into his role as an apprentice.
